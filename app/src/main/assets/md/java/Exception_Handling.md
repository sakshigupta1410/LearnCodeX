# **Exceptions**

As mentioned in the Errors chapter, different types of errors can occur while running a program - such as _**coding mistakes**_, _**invalid input**_, or _**unexpected situations**_.

When an error occurs, Java will normally stop and generate an error message. The technical term for this is: Java will throw an exception (throw an error).

## **Exception Handling (try and catch)**

Exception handling lets you **catch and handle errors** during runtime - so your program doesn't crash.

It uses different keywords:

* The **`try`** statement allows you to define a block of code to be **tested** for errors while it is being executed.

* The **`catch`** statement allows you to define a block of code to be **executed**, if an error occurs in the try block.

The try and catch keywords come in pairs:

**Syntax**


```
try {
//  Block of code to try
}
catch(Exception e) {
//  Block of code to handle errors
}
```


Consider the following example:

This will generate an error, because **myNumbers[10]** does not exist.

```
public class Main {
public static void main(String[ ] args) {
int[] myNumbers = {1, 2, 3};
System.out.println(myNumbers[10]); // error!
}
}
The output will be something like this:

Exception in thread "main" java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: 10
at Main.main(Main.java:4)
```

<br>

Note: **ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException** occurs when you try to access an index number that does not exist.

If an error occurs, we can use **try...catch** to catch the error and execute some code to handle it:

**Example**


```
public class Main {
public static void main(String[ ] args) {
try {
int[] myNumbers = {1, 2, 3};
System.out.println(myNumbers[10]);
} catch (Exception e) {
System.out.println("Something went wrong.");
}
}
}


The output will be:

Something went wrong.

```

## **Finally**

The **finally** statement lets you _execute_ code, after _try...catch_, regardless of the result:

**Example**


```
public class Main {
public static void main(String[] args) {
try {
int[] myNumbers = {1, 2, 3};
System.out.println(myNumbers[10]);
} catch (Exception e) {
System.out.println("Something went wrong.");
} finally {
System.out.println("The 'try catch' is finished.");
}
}
}
```
The output will be:

**Something went wrong.
The 'try catch' is finished.**



### **The throw keyword**

* The `throw` statement allows you to create a _custom error_.

* The throw statement is used together with an exception type. There are many exception types available in Java: ArithmeticException, FileNotFoundException, ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException, SecurityException, etc:

**Example**

Throw an exception if age is **below 18** `(print "Access denied")`. 
If age is 18 or older, `print "Access granted"`:


```
public class Main {
static void checkAge(int age) {
if (age < 18) {
throw new ArithmeticException("Access denied - You must be at least 18 years old.");
}
else {
System.out.println("Access granted - You are old enough!");
}
}

public static void main(String[] args) {
checkAge(15); // Set age to 15 (which is below 18...)
}
}
```
The output will be:

**Exception in thread "main" java.lang.ArithmeticException: Access denied - You must be at least 18 years old.
at Main.checkAge(Main.java:4)
at Main.main(Main.java:12)**



If age was 20, you would not get an exception:

**Example**


```
checkAge(20);
The output will be:

Access granted - You are old enough!
```
